					<p>I am a dedicated child care provider who enjoys assisting parents who are unable to be there for their children 24 hours a day , and the knowledge and perspective that i have developed in my years as a Nanny has helped to strengthened my skills as a child care provider as well as a future educator. I have been successful at helping families in many areas of everyday life and I attribute this success to my ability to plan, schedule, and handle many different tasks at once. This flexibility will help me in the classroom, where there are many different personalities and learning styles</p>
