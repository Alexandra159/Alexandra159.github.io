		<h2>AfricaBurn</h2>
			<img src="photos/africaburn.jpg">
		<p>Since its founding in 2007 on a private farm called Stonehenge next to the Tankwa Karoo National Park far away from civilization (about 250 miles outside Cape Town) in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa. Like at Burning Man, you better be pretty intentional in your desire to make this trek. Given that the event is during the southern hemisphere’s early fall, there are so many similarities to Burning Man, you may feel like you’re hallucinating. In fact, the event is held over South Africa’s version of Labor Day, May Day. And, given the nature of the event, that may be true depending upon your predilections.</p>
